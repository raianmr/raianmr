### Salutations, Wanderer 

I'm a CSE sophomore based in Dhaka. 

- I like working on 
    - games, 
    - graphics, 
    - and servers 

- I'm currently learning 
    - Go, 
    - Unity, 
    - Vulkan, 
    - and FastAPI

- I'm looking forward to learning 
    - Rust, 
    - Svelte,
    - Unreal, 
    - and WebGPU 

- I have experience in 
    - absolutely nothing worth noting 

There isn't much to showcase on my public profile right now, but I hope to change that soon.
